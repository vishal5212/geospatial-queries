Overview
MongoDB supports the GeoJSON object types listed on this page.

To specify GeoJSON data, use an embedded document with:

a field named type that specifies the GeoJSON object type and

a field named coordinates that specifies the objectâ€™s coordinates.

If specifying latitude and longitude coordinates, list the longitude first and then latitude:

Valid longitude values are between -180 and 180, both inclusive.
Valid latitude values are between -90 and 90 (both inclusive).
<field>: { type: <GeoJSON type> , coordinates: <coordinates> }
MongoDB geospatial queries on GeoJSON objects calculate on a sphere; MongoDB uses the WGS84 reference system for geospatial queries on GeoJSON objects.

Point
The following example specifies a GeoJSON Point:

{ type: "Point", coordinates: [ 40, 5 ] }
LineString
The following example specifies a GeoJSON LineString:

{ type: "LineString", coordinates: [ [ 40, 5 ], [ 41, 6 ] ] }
Polygon
Polygons consist of an array of GeoJSON LinearRing coordinate arrays. These LinearRings are closed LineStrings. Closed LineStrings have at least four coordinate pairs and specify the same position as the first and last coordinates.

The line that joins two points on a curved surface may or may not contain the same set of co-ordinates that joins those two points on a flat surface. The line that joins two points on a curved surface will be a geodesic. Carefully check points to avoid errors with shared edges, as well as overlaps and other types of intersections.

Polygons with a Single Ring
The following example specifies a GeoJSON Polygon with an exterior ring and no interior rings (or holes). The first and last coordinates must match in order to close the polygon:

{
  type: "Polygon",
  coordinates: [ [ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 3 , 6 ] , [ 6 , 1 ] , [ 0 , 0  ] ] ]
}
For Polygons with a single ring, the ring cannot self-intersect.

Polygons with Multiple Rings
For Polygons with multiple rings:

The first described ring must be the exterior ring.
The exterior ring cannot self-intersect.
Any interior ring must be entirely contained by the outer ring.
Interior rings cannot intersect or overlap each other. Interior rings cannot share an edge.
The following example represents a GeoJSON polygon with an interior ring:

{
  type : "Polygon",
  coordinates : [
     [ [ 0 , 0 ] , [ 3 , 6 ] , [ 6 , 1 ] , [ 0 , 0 ] ],
     [ [ 2 , 2 ] , [ 3 , 3 ] , [ 4 , 2 ] , [ 2 , 2 ] ]
  ]
}

MultiPoint
New in version 2.6: Requires Versions

GeoJSON MultiPoint embedded documents encode a list of points.

{
  type: "MultiPoint",
  coordinates: [
     [ -73.9580, 40.8003 ],
     [ -73.9498, 40.7968 ],
     [ -73.9737, 40.7648 ],
     [ -73.9814, 40.7681 ]
  ]
}
MultiLineString
New in version 2.6: Requires Versions

The following example specifies a GeoJSON MultiLineString:

{
  type: "MultiLineString",
  coordinates: [
     [ [ -73.96943, 40.78519 ], [ -73.96082, 40.78095 ] ],
     [ [ -73.96415, 40.79229 ], [ -73.95544, 40.78854 ] ],
     [ [ -73.97162, 40.78205 ], [ -73.96374, 40.77715 ] ],
     [ [ -73.97880, 40.77247 ], [ -73.97036, 40.76811 ] ]
  ]
}
MultiPolygon
New in version 2.6: Requires Versions

The following example specifies a GeoJSON MultiPolygon:

{
  type: "MultiPolygon",
  coordinates: [
     [ [ [ -73.958, 40.8003 ], [ -73.9498, 40.7968 ], [ -73.9737, 40.7648 ], [ -73.9814, 40.7681 ], [ -73.958, 40.8003 ] ] ],
     [ [ [ -73.958, 40.8003 ], [ -73.9498, 40.7968 ], [ -73.9737, 40.7648 ], [ -73.958, 40.8003 ] ] ]
  ]
}
GeometryCollection
New in version 2.6: Requires Versions

The following example stores coordinates of GeoJSON type GeometryCollection:

{
  type: "GeometryCollection",
  geometries: [
     {
       type: "MultiPoint",
       coordinates: [
          [ -73.9580, 40.8003 ],
          [ -73.9498, 40.7968 ],
          [ -73.9737, 40.7648 ],
          [ -73.9814, 40.7681 ]
       ]
     },
     {
       type: "MultiLineString",
       coordinates: [
          [ [ -73.96943, 40.78519 ], [ -73.96082, 40.78095 ] ],
          [ [ -73.96415, 40.79229 ], [ -73.95544, 40.78854 ] ],
          [ [ -73.97162, 40.78205 ], [ -73.96374, 40.77715 ] ],
          [ [ -73.97880, 40.77247 ], [ -73.97036, 40.76811 ] ]
       ]
     }
  ]
